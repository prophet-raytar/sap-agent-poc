Short text
    Time limit exceeded.

What happened?
    The program "Z_CUSTOM_INVENTORY_REPORT" has exceeded the maximum
    permitted runtime without interruption.
    
    The maximum runtime is defined by the system profile parameter
    "rdisp/max_wprun_time".
    Current value: 600 seconds.

Error analysis
    After 600 seconds, the system stopped the process to prevent
    blocking the work process.
    
    This usually indicates an infinite loop or a database selection 
    without an index.

Information on where terminated
    Termination occurred in the ABAP program "Z_CUSTOM_INVENTORY_REPORT" - in "CALCULATE_STOCK".
