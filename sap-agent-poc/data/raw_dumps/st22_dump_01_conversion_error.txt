Short text
    Unable to interpret "2026-Feb-07" as a number.

What happened?
    Error in the ABAP Application Program
    The current ABAP program "SAPLVA01" had to be terminated because it has
    come across a statement that unfortunately cannot be executed.

Error analysis
    An exception occurred that is explained in detail below.
    The exception, which is assigned to class 'CX_SY_CONVERSION_NO_NUMBER', was not
    caught in procedure "CONVERT_DATE_FORMAT" "(FORM)", nor was it propagated by a
    RAISING clause.
    Since the caller of the procedure could not have anticipated that the
    exception would occur, the current program is terminated.
    The reason for the exception is:
    The program attempted to interpret the value "2026-Feb-07" as a number,
    but the value contains characters that are not digits.
